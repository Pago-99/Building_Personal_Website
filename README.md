# Building_Personal_Website

This project involves building my private website.

## How to Use the Visitors Page (Including Administrator Access)

1. **Posting a Message**  
   Enter your ID and password to write a message. You can check the **Secret** box to hide both your name and message, or leave it unchecked to make them public. The timestamp will always be displayed, regardless of secrecy.

2. **Managing Your Messages**  
   Log in with the same ID and password you used to post a message to view, edit (including toggling public/private), or delete it. While logged in, click **Logout** to sign out. Attempting to log in with credentials that haven’t been used to post will display “Invalid ID or Password.”

3. **Administrator Login**  
   **IMPORTANT:** Log in with  
ID: Admin  
Password: 1234
to see all messages (including secret ones) and delete any message as needed.
